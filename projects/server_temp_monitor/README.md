# Server Room Temperature Monitor

This is a beginner Python project that simulates a temperature monitoring system for server rooms.  
The script continuously accepts temperature values, detects overheating, and counts the number of alerts.

## Features

- Accepts user input for server room temperature  
- Monitors temperatures in real time (via `while` loop)  
- Detects overheating (above 30 Â°C)  
- Counts the number of alerts  
- Ends safely with the `stop` command  
- Provides a final summary of alerts

## What I learned

This project helped me practice:

- `input()` and type conversion using `float()`
- Conditional logic with `if / else`
- Looping with `while`
- Using `break` and counting with variables
- Clean and readable output messages
